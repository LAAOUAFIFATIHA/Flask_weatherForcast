<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<div align="justify">
For our research, a variety of data must be gathered and analyzed. First, we can obtain weather data for each day, week, month, or year from the API where we obtain the information. Subsequently, we gather user data that includes likes and dislikes for the daily weather. This data is loaded into a SQLMyAlchemy database, allowing us to forecast whether or not the user will enjoy the second weather.</div>

Our solution leverages the YOLOv8 segmentation model to detect malignant regions in breast cancer images, enabling accurate and efficient diagnosis of the disease. By training the model on a comprehensive dataset of annotated images, we can improve its performance and robustness, achieving superior accuracy and precision in detecting cancerous regions. Our approach involves preprocessing the images to enhance their quality and extract key spectral features, enabling the model to identify malignant regions with high accuracy. By combining advanced machine learning techniques with domain-specific knowledge, we can develop a powerful tool for early cancer detection and diagnosis, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.
